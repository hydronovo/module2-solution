                        The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of
                        domesticated fowl, originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult
                        male bird, and younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon.
                        An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

                        Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been
                        eating beef since prehistoric times. Beef is a source of protein and nutrients.
                        Most beef can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or
                        steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.),
                        while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, which
                        are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or
                        used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage.

                        Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared
                        vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of
                        ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its
                        presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari
                        (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).

                        Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown
                        rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel,
                        yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often
                        served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon
                        (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
